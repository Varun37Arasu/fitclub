IMPORTANT: PLACEHOLDER PDFs NEEDED

The backend is fully configured and ready to send emails with PDF attachments.

However, you need to create and upload the actual plan PDFs before the system can work.

REQUIRED FILES (7 PDFs):
1. veg-plan.pdf
2. non-veg-plan.pdf
3. keto-plan.pdf
4. 8-week-plan.pdf
5. 12-week-plan.pdf
6. 24-week-plan.pdf
7. annual-plan.pdf

QUICK START (For Testing):
If you want to test the email system before creating full PDFs:

1. Create 7 simple PDFs with placeholder content (see README.md for template)
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this folder
4. Push to GitHub - Vercel will auto-deploy
5. Test payment flow - you'll receive the PDF via email

FULL PRODUCTION:
Once you have professional meal plans and workout programs ready:

1. Design them in Canva, Google Docs, or Word
2. Export as PDF (2-5 MB recommended)
3. Replace the placeholder PDFs with your professional ones
4. Push to GitHub

The email system will automatically attach the correct PDF based on the plan purchased.
